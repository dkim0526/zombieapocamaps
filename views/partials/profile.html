			Obtain and stockpile basic survival (the most important) items. Consider storing the following:
Jugs of water
Canned goods
Vacuum-sealed goods
Blanket and pillow
Medications
A weapon that you actually know how to use properly
A knife (in addition to a weapon)
Warm, long sleeved clothing (if your climate requires it)
Carrying bag (for moving and/or fleeing).



Store supplies for just getting by. Think about having these items at your disposal:
Batteries
Flashlights
Matches
Pot (for cooking or boiling water)
Plastic eating-ware (plate, mug, spoon, fork)
Rope or twine
Map
Permanent markers (something to write with)
Change of clothes
Can opener
Lighters
Camp stove and propane
Hatchet or axe
First aid book
Sunglasses
Duct tape
Glow sticks
Boots
Extra pants
Smartphone
Water filters
Other comfort items.

Here's a list for what you need to put in your emergency kit:[1]
Adhesive bandages, such as Band-Aids
Gauze
Medical tape
Ibuprofen (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID))
Acetaminophen/paracetamol (over-the-counter pain relief)
Antihistamine
Aspirin (over-the-counter pain relief)
Laxative
Iodine
Hand sanitizing liquid
Candles
A multi-use tool (aka a "hobo tool")
Phone charger (preferably solar)
Wood for burning
Towels
Life jackets, if your area is prone to flooding
Extra warm clothes
Paper towels
Solar charger (see below)
Pet food (enough for 30-90 days)
Tweezers
Plasters
Safety pins
Thermometer
Superglue
Toothpicks/needles.

To keep hygiene from being an issue on top of everything else, pack the following (you'll be glad you did):[1]
Toilet paper (a couple rolls will suffice)
Menstrual products
Toothbrush and toothpaste
Plastic garbage bags and ties
Shovel or trowel
Bleach
Soap and shampoo (those hotel samples are finally useful).


• Portable radio, preferably one that works with dead or no batteries, such as by a hand crank or combination powered with solar cells (available through survival and surplus outlets).

• First aid kit with first aid and survival handbooks (this book covers both).

• Water, water purification chemicals, and /or purifying filter. Enough to provide 1 gallon per person per day (see Chapter 5). Retort (foil) pouches can handle freezing in a car trunk, but most other water containers can’t handle freezing without the potential for bursting. Three gallons per person is heavy (24 lb), so I strongly suggest that you include a water filter and water treatment chemicals. I suggest pump-type backcountry filters, such as those made by Katadyn or MSR, that are rated to filter out all bacteria and have a carbon core to remove toxic chemicals. Also, supplement your filter(s) with purifying iodine crystals (or other chemicals), such as a “Polar Pure” water purification kit, to kill all viruses. Pump filters that are rated for virus removal have tiny pore sizes and tend to clog quickly (a clogged filter is worthless). Sports bottle-type purifying water filters are simple, reliable, compact, and inexpensive, but clog easier and won’t purify nearly as many gallons of water as the pump-type filters.

• Waterproof and windproof matches in a waterproof container, and a utility-type butane (large, with extended tip) lighter.

• Wool or pile blankets (avoid cotton) because they are warm when wet, or a sleeping bag. Also, a heat-reflective, waterproof “space blanket.” Fiber-pile, mountaineering-quality sleeping bags are great, if you have the space (avoid down sleeping bags, because they are worthless if wet).

• Flashlight with spare batteries, or a solar recharge flashlight. I highly recommend that you purchase a headlamp with LED bulbs. Headlamps leave your hands free to carry things, or work on things. LED bulbs use a fraction of the power, are far more shock resistant, and last far longer than traditional light bulbs, so your batteries last many times longer.

• Candles (useful for lighting fires with damp wood) and light sticks (emergency light when nothing else works or explosive gases are present).

• Toiletries, including toilet paper, toothbrush, soap, razor, shampoo, sanitary napkins (also good for severe bleeding wounds), a pack of dental floss (for sewing and tying things), sunscreen, extra eyeglasses, diapers, and so on.

• Food for 3 days per person, minimum. Use foods you will eat and that store well, such as nuts, sport bars, canned vegetables, fruits, meats, dry cereals, and military-type preserved meals (available at surplus and survival stores).

• A Swiss Army knife, Leatherman, or other stainless steel multitool knife with scissors, can opener, blades, and screwdrivers.

• Map, compass, and whistle. When you are in a weakened state, or have a parched throat, a whistle may draw someone’s attention and save your life. In smoke or fog, a compass may be the only thing pointing you in the right direction. The dial on the compass should glow in the dark.

• Sewing kit with extra heavy-duty thread. Should be strong enough to stitch a torn strap onto your backpack (I never travel in the backcountry without a sewing kit).

• Towel or dishcloth.

• Knives, forks, spoons, and so on. A camping “mess kit” is a compact set of utensils.

• Tent and/or 50-foot roll of plastic sheeting for shelter.

• Extra clothing, such as long underwear, hat, jacket, waterproof mittens, leather work gloves, rain coat or poncho, sturdy boots, and so on. Remember that cotton is very cold when wet, but wool and specialty outdoor clothing (usually polyester) wick moisture and are warm when wet.

• Entertainment for kids and other special needs (prescription medicines, diapers, extra glasses, etc.).

• 25 kitchen-size garbage bags and lime or sewage treatment chemicals (powdered type preferred) for garbage and toilet sewage. A few large heavy-duty garbage bags can double for raincoats, ground cloths, and shelter.

• 50 feet of heavy-duty nylon string or light rope.

• Record of bank numbers and important telephone numbers.

• Spare checks and cash. Many Katrina victims were caught without any cash. TIP: Use a bank that has widespread branch locations so their records won’t disappear in a severe local disaster, leaving you with no bank account access.

• OPTIONAL ITEMS: A compact stove with fuel, like one of the MSR multifuel stoves.
