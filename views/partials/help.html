				<p>This tab will help you find the safest areas to go in the case of a zombie apocalypse.
					How do we determine this? <strong>Answer</strong> We use a formula based off of these factors:
					<ul>
						<li>Population Density: The higher the population, the more chances that there will be more infected. We think that avoiding these high population areas will give you a better chance to not get infected.</li>
						<li>Crime Rate: More crime = more danger. Dangerous areas will most likely have more looters and violent people in the area. Getting away from these crime intensive areas will make you safer.</li>
						<li>Death Rate: The more people that are dying, the more likely there will be more infected zombies. These death rates from Delphi include crime and sickness related deaths. Staying away from sickness and crime will keep you safe</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Formula:</strong> crime + death + population = rating <br>
						The higher the rating, the more dangerous an area </p>
